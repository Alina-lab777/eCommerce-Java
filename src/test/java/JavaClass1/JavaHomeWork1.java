     * Java Data Type:
     * Primitive:
     *
     * byte --- can store numbers from -127 to 128
     * short--- can store anything from - 320000 to 32000
     * int --- can store -2 000 000 000 to 2 000 000 000
     * long--- can store -9 000 000 000 000 000 to 9 000 000 000 000 , always identified  by "L"
     * float--- can store fractional numbers and identified by "f"
     * double--- only stores fractional numbers
     * boolean--- checks whether statement "True" or "False"
     * char---- single character in single quotation marks like "a"
     *
     *
     *
     * Non-primitive:
     *
     * String --- some combination of letters and words;
     * Array --- Datatype variableName = [someValue1, someValue2, someValue3, someValue4]
     * Classes --- all user created Classes;
     *
     *
     *In Java there is position of values known as "index" and we can call certain Index number bypassing Index number
     * Index starts from Zero
