     * Polymorphism ---> many forms, and it occurs when we have many classes that related to each other by
     *                  inheritance. In Java Polymorphism is used to perform different tasks.
     *
     *
     * TYPES:
     *
     * 1. Compile-time polymorphism ---> static binding, this applies only to "method overloading";
     *
     *
     * 2. Run-time polymorphism ---> dynamic binding, this can be achieved only in Parent-Child relationship;
     *      when the Child class inherits all properties and changes its behaviour by "method overriding";
     *
