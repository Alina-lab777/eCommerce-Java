/**
 *HomeWork for 3rd Class:
 *
 * Int a = 15;
 * Int b = 3;
 * Find out if “a” is equals to “b”
 * Find out if “a” is greater than  to “b”
 * Find out if “a” is less than  to “b”
 * Find out if “a” does’t equal  than  to “b”
 * Find out if “a” is greater than  to “b”
 * and print result to Console output with appropriate message;
 * =============================================================
 * Int c = 20
 * Find out if value of c is greater than 10 and less than 30;
 * Find out if value of c is greater than 50 or less than 30;
 * Find out if value of c is greater than 10 and less than 30 - reverse your program;
 * =============================================================
 * Practice Pre Post Increments:
 * int x = 4;
 * int y = (++x) + 100;
 *
 * int x = 4;
 * int y = (x++) + 100;
 *
 * ============================================================
 * Practice Pre Post decrement:
 * int aa = 10;
 * int bb = (--aa) + 100;
 * System.out.println(bb);
 *
 * int aa = 10;
 * int bb = (aa–-) + 100;
 * System.out.println(bb);
 *
 * ============================================================
 * Ternary Operator:
 *
 * int number_1 = -120;
 * int number_2 = 250;
 * double number_3 = 0.99;
 * double number_4 = -110;
 *
 * Use Ternary Operator's syntax, create STRING variables and within that variable write ternary
 * expression to check whether these numbers are > 0, your Expressions should be :“Positive number” “Negative number”;
 * In System.out.println pass created String variables to print output for each results.
 *
 *
 * Use Ternary Operator's syntax, create INT variables and within that variable write ternary
 * expression to check whether these numbers are > 0, your Expressions should be : intExpression1 : intExpression2;
 * In System.out.println pass created INT variables to print output for each results.
