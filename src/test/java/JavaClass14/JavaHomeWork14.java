         * 1. Write the Fibonacci series program (next number is the sum of previous two numbers
         * for example 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc.
         * The first two numbers of fibonacci series are 0 and 1)
         *
         *  Use this flow:
         *      1. Create int num1 = 0; int num2 = 1; int num3; int count = 10;
         *      2. Start Your Loop starting from 0 and less= than count;
         *      3. num3 = num1 + num2;
         *      4. sout it here;
         *      5. In order to see added values at the next index, do some "magic" with reassigning num1,num2,num3;
         *      6. Just think;
         *
         *      
         *
         * 2. Print the biggest number in Array of int
         *      Example: int[] arr = {15,150,25,40,57,80}
         *      Output should be: Biggest number in given array: 150
         *
         *
         *
         *
         * 3. Print the smallest number in Array of int
         *      Example: int[] arr = {112,150,25,40,57,80}
         *      Output should be: Smallest number in given array: 25
         *
         *      Use this flow:
         *        1. Start the For Loop;
         *        2. Create int createdIntVar and assign it to arr[0] --- arr at Zero Index (112)
         *        3. if statement put comparison arr[LoopVar] vs createdIntVar
         *        4. sout the smallest number;
         *
